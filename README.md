# StockStalker
HackUMBC Project Fall '17

This project is a desktop app that displays historical stock data over a period of time of the user's choice. It allows the user to select two stocks and compare how an investment of a certain amount would have fared for both, and which stock would have been a better choice. 
Historical data can also help users to make wise decisions when making future investments.
