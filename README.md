HackUMBC Project Fall '17

This project is a desktop app that displays historical stock data over a period of time of the user's choice. It allows the user to select two stocks and compare their performance over a set period of time. Their value can be viewed in terms of daily, weekly, or monthly performance, and can be displayed in terms of their dollar value or percent of change over the last time interval.

A dollar amount can be entered, and users can see how an investment in either stock would have fared, including their final return, the monetary gain/loss, and the percent of change in the investment they would have seen. Historical data can also help users to make wise decisions when making future investments.
