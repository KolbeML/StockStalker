# StockStalker
HackUMBC Project Fall '17

This project is a desktop app that will display historical stock data over a period of user's choice. It allows the user to select two stocks and compare how the investment would have fared, and which stock would have been a better choice. 
Historical data helps the user to make wise decision when they invest in furture stocks.
